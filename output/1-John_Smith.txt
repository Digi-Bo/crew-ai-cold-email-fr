Subject: Join our Skool Community for Weekly Coaching Calls and More!

Hey John! ðŸ‘‹

Just a quick reminder that we have a Skool community where you can join us for weekly coaching calls every Tuesday at 6pm EST. The community is completely free and we're about to hit 500 users! We'd love to have you join us.

If you have any questions or need help with your projects, this is a great place to connect with others and get support. Plus, you can share your ideas and experiences related to backend development in our community.

And if you're interested in AI content, be sure to check out my channel for more videos. Don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe to stay up-to-date on the latest news.

Hope to see you in the community!

Best,
Brandon Hancock
